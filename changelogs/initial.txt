Configuring settings

* You need to supply the "root" of your JS codebase (i.e., the location where your JS files reside).
* You may also supply the location of your RequireJS configuration for AMD codebases
* You may also supply the location of your SASS files.

These can be specified by going to

and adding:

{
  "root": "path/to/my/js",
  "config": "path/to/my/requirejs/config.js",   # Optional
  "sass_root": "path/to/my/sass"                # Optional
}

* Please modify the "root", "config", and "sass_root" values according to your codebase.
