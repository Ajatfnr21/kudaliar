Configuring settings
---

You need to supply the "root" of your JS codebase (i.e., the location where your JS files reside).

This can be specified by going to

`Preferences -> Package Settings -> Dependents -> Settings - User`

and adding:

{
  "root": "public/assets/js"
}

* Please modify the "root" value according to your codebase.

Default key bindings

By default, the following key bindings have been supplied:

OSX:

* Find Dependents: `CMD + Option + Up arrow`
* Jump to dependency: `CMD + Option + Right arrow` or `CMD + Option + Click`
