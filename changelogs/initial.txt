Configuring settings
---

You need to supply the "root" of your JS codebase (i.e., the location where your JS files reside).

This can be specified by going to

`Preferences -> Package Settings -> Dependents -> Settings - User`

and adding:

{
  "root": "path/to/my/js",
  "config": "path/to/my/requirejs/config.js"
}

* Please modify the "root" and "config" values according to your codebase.

By default, the following key bindings have been supplied:

OSX:

* Find Dependents: `CMD + Option + Up arrow`
* Jump to dependency: `CMD + Option + Right arrow` or `CMD + Option + Click`
