Big updates
----

1. Seamless node-dependents updates
2. Cross platform support (Windows and Linux)
3. Jump to dependencies (within your root) from anywhere in your codebase

The node tool powering this plugin (node-dependents) has been
integrated into the sublime-dependents codebase.

This means you shouldn't ever have to install dependents manually.
Feel free to delete your local install of node-dependents from your codebase

Along with this is support for Windows and Linux operating systems.

Ping me @mrjoelkemp if this update breaks anything.

You don't have to do anything to get these updates.
