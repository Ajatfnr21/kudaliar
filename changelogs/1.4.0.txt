Find Aliased Dependents
---

Finding the dependents of a module will now use your requirejs config to resolve aliases

### How can I start using this?


Please install the newest version of node-dependents in your project's root directory:

npm install dependents



In your settings, you'll need to supply the path to your RequireJS configuration file:

Go to: Preferences -> Package Settings -> Dependents -> Settings - User

and add the following property to the settings file:

"config": "path/to/my/config.js"
