Bug fixes

* Better support for relative dependencies (CommonJS).
* Better handling of missing settings from a .deprc file

You should now have no problems using the features on CommonJS codebases.

Note: If you want to use this plugin on multiple codebases,
I highly recommend creating a .deprc file with your settings (root, config, sass_root)
and adding .deprc to your global gitignore if you don't want
to commit the configuration.
