New Feature: Copy module path to the clipboard

`Command + Shift + C` (OSX) or

1. Within a file, right click to open the context menu
2. Click on `Dependents -> Copy path to the clipboard`

Copy the rootless path of the current module to the clipboard. (Sass and JS)

For example, if the root is `assets/js` and the filename is `path/to/assets/js/myFeature/file.js`,
then the command will copy `myFeature/file` to the clipboard.

This is useful when you want to include the current module as a dependency of another module.
