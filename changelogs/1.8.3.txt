Bug fix
---

Fixing a bug broke finding dependents.

Basically, with the merging of the plugin and node tool's codebases, it was necessary to
indicate to sublime text to package this plugin differently. Without this, trying to execute
commands on the node tool would result in a nasty error.

Apologies for the inconvenience.
