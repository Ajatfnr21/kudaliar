Jump to a plugin loaded dependency
----

You can now jump to dependencies that use requirejs plugin loaders
like hgn, hbs, css, txt.

How can I start using this?

1. Please update node-dependents via:

npm install dependents

2. Be sure to have the path to your requirejs config set in your settings,
if you haven't set it already.

Go to: Preferences -> Package Settings -> Dependents -> Settings - User

and add the following property to the settings file:

"config": "path/to/my/config.js"
