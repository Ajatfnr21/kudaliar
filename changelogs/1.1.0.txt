Jump to the module under your cursor

How to activate it:
1. Add the new key binding below to Preferences -> Key Bindings - User
2. Change the "root" within the key binding if you need to
3. Within a JS file, place your cursor over the dependency path you want to go to
4. Press cmd + option + right (or the key combination you defined) to jump to that file

New key binding

Add this as a new key binding in Preferences -> Key Bindings - User:

{
  "keys": ["super+alt+right"],
  "command": "dependents",
  "args": {
    "root": "public/assets/js",
    "mode": "dependency"
  }
}

This key binding should **not** replace the key binding you have for finding the dependents
