New Feature: Exclude files and folders
----

Now you can exclude specific files and folder names from the search for dependents.

If you're using the plugin in a large codebase, this can shave off a few seconds.


To use this, add the following setting to Preferences -> Package Settings -> Dependents -> Settings - User

"exclude": [
  "jquery.js",
  "someOtherFile.js",
  "plugins/"
]

Note: The trailing slash is not required for indicating that a name is of a directory.
