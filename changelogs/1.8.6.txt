Better error reporting
---

Now showing a dialog with the error message to indicate that something is wrong.

If you do encounter errors from recently upgrading, please try:

1. Package Control -> Remove Package -> Dependents
2. Restart Sublime Text
3. Package Control -> Install Package -> Dependents
4. Restart Sublime Text

That should fix the problem. Please report errors to @mrjoelkemp or github.com/mrjoelkemp/sublime-dependents
