Webpack support!

The JumpToDependency feature supports jumping to dependncies that are aliased via a webpack config.

You can now add a webpack_config to your .deprc file that points to the location of your webpack config:

{
  "webpack_config": "path/to/my/webpack.config.js"
}

Additional Dependents features will support Webpack resolution in future updates.
