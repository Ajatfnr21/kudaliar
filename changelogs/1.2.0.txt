Major Cleanup
---

There were several pain points that have been addressed:

1. You shouldn't have to supply the root for every new feature
2. You shouldn't have to manually set up key and mouse bindings
3. Adding new features should require little to no work from the user

Here are the quick changes you need to make to take advantage of this release.

---
Configuring settings
---

You need to supply the "root" of your JS codebase (i.e., the location where your JS files reside) only once now.

This should be specified by going to

`Preferences -> Package Settings -> Dependents -> Settings - User`

and adding:

{
  "root": "public/assets/js"
}

* Please modify the "root" value according to your codebase.

From now on, new features can simply read that setting.

---
Default key and mouse bindings
---

By default, the following key bindings have been supplied:

OSX:

* Find Dependents: `CMD + Option + Up arrow`
* Jump to dependency: `CMD + Option + Right arrow` or `CMD + Option + Click`

**You can delete the custom bindings that you provided in previous versions.**

---
No Windows support, yet
---

Unfortunately, there are a few issues to sort out before
Windows users can use Dependents. I'm working on it.
