Find Dependents: Webpack support

The Find Dependents feature now supports processing modules that use Webpack aliasing.

To use, you need a webpack_config entry in your .deprc file that points to the location of your webpack config:

{
  "webpack_config": "path/to/my/webpack.config.js"
}

Additional Dependents features will support Webpack resolution in future updates.
