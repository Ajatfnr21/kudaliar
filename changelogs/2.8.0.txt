Bug fix: Now supporting nested deprc files. If you have a deprc file within a subdirectory, Dependents uses it.
This is pretty huge for folks who have multiple projects/repos open within a single sublime window.

New Feature: Now supporting the popular CSS preprocessor, Stylus. All of the features should work for Stylus codebases.

New setting: `styles_root` for setting the location of all stylesheets. It replaces `sass_root` since Dependents
supports more than just Sass, but you can keep using `sass_root` without a problem.
