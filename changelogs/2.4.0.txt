New Feature: Find relevant app entry points
----

To use:

* Right click on a file to open the context menu
* Click on Dependents -> Find relevant app entry points

Optional:

If you're using RequireJS, you can optionally set the "build_config"
setting to supply the location to your Rjs build configuration file.
  * This should have a "modules" section that lists your entry points/bundles
