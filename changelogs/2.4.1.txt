Bug Fix: Specify node location
---

Previously, it was assumed that on an OSX machine, the default
node path was /usr/local/bin. This is not always the case
and users were experiencing error messages where
the node version could not be found.

If you need to, you can now specify your particular
node path by setting the "node_path" setting:

"node_path": "/path/to/a/folder"

This will default to /usr/local/bin if not supplied.
