In your terminal, please upgrade dependents by running: npm install dependents

Originally, this plugin took a few seconds to get results if your codebase is large (around 1000 JS files or more).
I just added some parallel processing capabilities to the underlying Node.js tool, dependents, to cut down on the time.

Please upgrade the node tool dependents to get this performance upgrade.
Since upgrades to the node tool do not affect the sublime text plugin's code, you have to manually upgrade the tool.
