Bug fixes and enhancements:

* Lots of AMD partial resolution bugs were fixed with the Jump To Dependency feature.
* Find Dependents: you can now find the dependents of any templates or styles that are imported by AMD modules
* Get Tree: imported templates and styles will now show up as part of the dependency tree
