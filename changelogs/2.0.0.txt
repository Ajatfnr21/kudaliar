New Feature: Find Sass Dependents
---

Now you can find all the SASS stylesheets that depend on another stylesheet (typically a partial).


You'll need to set the 'sass_root' property in your settings:

Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Dependents -> Settings - User

"sass_root": "path/to/my/sass"



Simply open a partial and use the existing keyboard shortcuts to find the dependents.
