New Feature: Per-project settings
----

You can now create a .deprc file within your projects
to configure the "root" and "config" on a per-project basis.

An example .deprc file within a project would look like:

{
  "root": "path/to/my/js",
  "config": "path/to/my/config.js"
}

Where you would change the values of "root" and (optionally) "config"
to match your directory structure.
