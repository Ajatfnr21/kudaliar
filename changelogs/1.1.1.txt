Using the mouse to jump to a dependency
---

1. Create a new (or modify existing if you have one) .sublime-mousemap file:

Windows - create Default (Windows).sublime-mousemap in %appdata%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User

Linux - create Default (Linux).sublime-mousemap in ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User

Mac - create Default (OSX).sublime-mousemap in ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User

2. Add the following binding

[
  {
    "button": "button1",
    "count": 1,
    "modifiers": ["super", "alt"],
    "press_command": "drag_select",
    "command": "dependents",
    "args": {
      "root": "public/assets/js",
      "mode": "dependency"
    }
  }
]

* Note: You do not need the opening/closing square brackets [] if you are modifying an existing .sublime-mousemap file.

3. Modify the root according to the location of JS files in your codebase

Now, you can hold down CMD + Option and Click on the path of a dependency to jump to that file!
