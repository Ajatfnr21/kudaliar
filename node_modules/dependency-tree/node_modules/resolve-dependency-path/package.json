  "readme": "### resolve-dependency-path\n\n> Convert a dependency path into a filepath\n\nI literally wrote this simple function in a handful of projects and decided it should\nbe its own module.\n\n### Usage\n\n```js\nvar resolvePath = require('resolve-dependency-path');\n\nvar resolved = resolvePath(depPath, filename, directory);\n```\n\n* `depPath`: the actual dependency path (probably extracted from a `require()`)\n* filename: the file that required this dependency (likely the file whose dependencies are being extracted)\n* directory: the root of all modules being processed. Dependencies are often about this root unless they're relative.\n\n### Example\n\nIf you have a file like:\n\n*myapp/foo.js*\n\n```js\nvar require('./bar');\n```\n\nThen if you want to open the file associated with the dependency, you need to resolve `./bar` onto the filesystem.\n\nSince `./bar` is a relative path, it should be resolved relative to `foo.js`,\nmore specifically the directory containing `foo.js`, `myapp/`. This resolution would yield\n`myapp/bar.js`.\n\nThis is why the `filename` attribute is required to use this library.\n\nIf you have a non-relative dependency path like:\n\n*myapp/foo.js*\n\n```js\ndefine([\n  'bar'\n], function(bar) {\n\n});\n```\n\nThen `bar` is relative to the root of all files, `myapp`. The resolution would yield\n`myapp/bar.js`.\n\nA more complex example with subdirectories:\n\n*myapp/feature1/foo.js*\n\n```js\ndefine([\n  'feature2/bar'\n], function(bar) {\n\n});\n```\n\nThe dependency `feature2/bar` is relative to the root of all files, `myapp`, *not* the file `foo.js`.\n\nThis is why the `directory` attribute is required to use this library.",
