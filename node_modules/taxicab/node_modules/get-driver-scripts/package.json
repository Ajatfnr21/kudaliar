  "readme": "#### get-driver-scripts\n\nGets the entry point filepaths to an application from a build configuration\nor by finding them about a directory.\n\n`npm install get-driver-scripts`\n\n### Usage\n\n```js\nvar getDrivers = require('get-driver-scripts');\n\ngetDrivers({\n  directory: 'path/to/my/js',\n  success: function(err, drivers) {\n\n  }\n})\n```\n\n##### Optional properties:\n\n* `exclusions`: a list of (sub)directory names to exclude from the search\n* `buildConfig`: a RequireJS build configuration that [contains a list of `modules`](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#wholeproject)\n * This config will be parsed and you'll get back the filepaths of those modules\n* `config`: a RequireJS configuration that lists aliased paths.\n * This is necessary when you don't supply a build config and want the plugin to find all of the driver scripts.\n * Aliased paths need to be resolved to real filepaths during the search",
