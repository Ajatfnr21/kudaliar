### Installation

You can install `Dependents` via Package Control.

Don't see it? Try reinstalling Package Control. Alternatively, add the repository and install it:

1. Package Control -> Add Repository
2. Enter `https://github.com/dependents/Dependents`
3. Package Control -> Install Package
4. Choose Dependents

#### Nodejs Dependency

You **must** have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. Anything v0.10 and above is fine.

* Note: The Node.js windows installer will add the install directory to the `PATH` variable but you must reboot to reload it.

##### NVM Users

[NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) will install Nodejs outside of the standard binary location. If you encounter an error where your Node executable cannot be found,
please override the `node_path` in User settings:

* Preferences -> Package Settings -> Dependents -> Settings - User

```
{
  "node_path": "path/to/the/node/install/directory"
}
```

* This will allow Dependents to find the Node binary for every codebase
